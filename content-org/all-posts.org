Having recently started a PhD, I've been experimenting with ways of
taking notes. I was searching for a method of organising papers
I've read, to accrue a library that I can come back to as needed.
I also needed a way to associate notes with these papers.
I had certain requirements of any potential solution:

- *Seamless.* For notes to be useful, they need to be complete,
  consistent and thorough. In my experience, I've found that if the
  effort for note taking is too high, it is inevitable that
  notes will be incomplete, inconsistent and low quality.
  Note taking should be easy and maintainable, not a chore!
- *Minimal.* At the same time, hyper-optimised power user work-flows
  are undesirable. They take /forever/ to set up, and even longer
  to maintain. Anecdotally, I find myself using the most useful
  5% of workflows 95% of the time.
- *Discoverable.* After taking a note, it should be easy to find it
  again. Knowledge should be available on demand.
- *Free (and Open Source).* This goes without saying!

With these principles in mind, I want to demonstrate the system that
I've come up with and have great success with personally.

*** Zotero
[[https://www.zotero.org][Zotero]] is an open source reference-management tool that helps you
collect and organize sources for research. It allows you to
save papers to your library with one click of a browser extension!

*** Org Roam
[[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] is a mode in the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] [fn:2]  text editor for working with
text based note files. One can think of it like markdown,
but more extensible and /much more powerful/.
It supports rich note taking features, like \(\LaTeX\) support,
code blocks, tables, images, links etc.
[[https://www.orgroam.com][Org roam]] is an extension built atop org, which allows
you to organise and link your notes, in the style of
[[https://obsidian.md][Obsidian]] or [[https://roamresearch.com][Roam Research]], by connecting notes through backlinks.

My choice of tool here is because a) I already use and love
Emacs and b) the extensibility of Org Roam makes it possible to
personalise seamless workflows for my needs.

Let's say that I want to take notes about the paper I've just added
to my library. Having integrated Org Roam with Zotero, I can open
it directly with a few key presses, with a handy template filled
ready for me:

*** Org Noter

Naively taking notes, copying information from the PDF seems like
a waste of time: notes should augment what is written in the paper.
It is necessary for any notes that are taken to be contextualised
by what is in the paper. This point is extremely important,
and usually a large hinderence to note-taking. One solution is to
annotate the PDF directly. However this comes at the cost of
discoverability. It becomes difficult to organise and link together
ideas that have been scribbled in the margins of a PDF.
We should learn a thing or two from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem][Fermat's struggles]].

This is where org noter comes in. It is an extension to Org Mode
that syncs your notes with a PDF! It does this by storing metadata
(in text) within the org document. The simplicity yet startling
power of Org Mode is really starting to shine here! Here it is in
action on the note we started to capture earlier:

*** Finding and Linking Notes

As I mentioned earlier, Org Roam is what we're using to organise
our notes. It allows one to: Search for notes...

[[/images/org-roam-find.gif]]

Link to other notes...

[[/images/org-roam-insert-link.gif]]

Cite papers...

[[/images/org-cite-insert.gif]]

From the citation, one can open the note we created for the paper,
or open the PDF for the paper itself! Org roam also shows you backlinks,
allowing you to see other notes that link to it.

[[/images/org-roam-backlink.png]]

All these features make it effortless to find and traverse notes.

*** Configuration

All that being said, what about the requirement for minimalism?
It turns out, most of this functionality can be achieved out of the box with
[[https://github.com/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]. My configuration can be found [[https://github.com/shiva-tk/axolotl/blob/main/.doom.d/config.org][here]].

** DONE A Total Ordering on Films :programming:films:

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-09-20 Sat 18:32]
:END:

The train of thought that culminated in this project set off when my good friend (Rish)
sent me a list compiled by the New York Times of the "[[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/movies/best-movies-21st-century.html][100 Best Movies of the 21st Century]]".
Scrolling through the list idle mindedly, I picked out the films which I'd seen,
silently agreeing with the list for including them. However, when given more thought,
I started to wonder the methodology behind this ranking.

My first instinct was to turn to Letterboxd. In recent years, a film's average Letterboxd rating
has become a source of truth in some sense for me. My preconceived notions and expectations about a film
are determined mostly by its average rating. Even when selecting a film to watch on lazy evenings with my flatmates,
before committing to a film, we look at its reviews.

This satisfied my curiosity temporarily. I assumed that the New York Times would have considered various ratings
of the film. At the very least, ranking films by their average rating is a starting point, from which an official ranking
can be refined.

But then I started to think about my own practices when rating a film. The truth is,
I'm pretty terrible at assigning a rating to a film after I have seen it.
Even having watched and rated 234 of them (as of today) on Letterboxd.
There have been numerous occasions when, upon reviewing my Letterboxd activity,
I've noticed inconsistencies. Films that I preferred over others, which received a lower rating.
In a large part, my rating of a film is influenced by its average rating: safety in numbers, herd mentality.
My rating can't be /that/ incorrect if it's relatively close to the average.

I suppose that on the scale of thousands of reviews, the average rating of a film is a
relatively good indicator of how good it is. But on a personal level, my own ratings mean very little,
at least to me. I considered how I might compile my own ranking, "The 100 Best Movies of All Time (According to Shiva)".
I realised that it would actually be very difficult.

I was reminded of an idea I had seen in /The Social Network/, a film which coincidentally I like very much,
and placed 10th place on the NYT list[fn:1]:

#+begin_quote
*MARK:*
Yea, it’s on. I’m not gonna do the farm
animals but I like the idea of comparing
two people together. It gives the whole
thing a very “Turing” feel since people’s
ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say,
choosing a number to represent each
person’s hotness like they do on
hotornot.com. The first thing we’re going
to need is a lot of pictures.

#+caption: The creation of facemash, using an ELO ranking system, in /The Social Network/
[[/images/the-social-network-elo.gif]]

In the film, Mark Zuckerberg -- frustrated after breaking up with Jessica Albright --
creates a website called /Facemash/. The site asks users to pick the more attractive person out of two photos.
As people repeat this pairwise comparison, an overall ranking emerges.

Mathematically, what we usually call a “rating” is just a proxy for an underlying total ordering of films.
A score like 3/5, taken in isolation, tells us very little. It only becomes meaningful when we compare it
to the ratings of other films.

That got me thinking: what if we skipped the proxy altogether? Instead of assigning numbers to films,
we could uncover the ordering directly through comparisons. It’s hard to give a rating that faithfully
captures a film’s place in the hierarchy, but it’s much easier to choose the better of two when they’re placed side by side.

As such, the idea for [[https://github.com/shiva-tk/filmsmash][Filmsmash]] was born.

*** Building Filmsmash

The idea for Filmsmash was in place. At a high level, I wanted users to be able to rank their favourite movies,
by pairwise comparison. To get a list of movies that a user had seen, we turn to Letterboxd.

**** Letterboxd API (and Workaround)
Unfortunately, obtaining API keys for Letterboxd is difficult.
However, Letterboxd does allow users to download a dump of their data in a CSV format.
Good enough, I suppose. In my head I pictured users downloading a dump of their Letterboxd data,
giving it to Filmsmash, which then ran on the films they've seen to formulate a ranking.

**** TUI
I've always found good terminal based user interfaces to be extremely satisfying.
I decided that it would be fun to try building one for Filmsmash.
After some research into which libraries provided good support for building TUIs,
I settled on [[https://ratatui.rs/][Ratatui]], a Rust library for making TUIs.

**** Ranking Algorithm
While Mark Zuckerberg used an Elo-based system to rank candidates on Facemash,
I think a simple merge sort approach is a better fit for our app.
In Facemash, the same pairings could appear multiple times, and different people might give different answers --
so a single vote isn’t conclusive proof of which option is /better/.
That’s why a probabilistic system like Elo made sense there.
In our case, though, we’re assuming a single user with consistent preferences:
if you say you prefer Film A over Film B once, you’ll always prefer it.
The crucial difference is uncertainty -- Facemash had it, but for us, each comparison is definitive.

The downside to this approach is that we can't stop after an arbitrary number of comparisons,
the merge sort algorithm must complete. I wondered if this would require too many comparisons to be feasible.
The merge sort algorithm requires \(n \log n\) comparisons. I have 234 films that I've seen.
This means to rank the films I've watched, it would take \(234 \times \log(234)\) comparisons,
so around 1842 comparisons. If I average one comparison a second, it would take about thirty minutes.
Good enough. A fun way to kill time when exceedingly bored.

**** Film Metadata
I mentioned earlier that we obtain the films a user has seen by inspecting their Letterboxd data dump.
Inspecting the CSVs that are generated by Letterboxd, I realised that they were pretty limited,
containing only the essential information like a film's name and the year it was released.
While this is sufficient, I thought that our TUI might look a bit more fleshed out if it
included some metadata like the the director, or the plot. Luckily there are other APIs which handle this, like [[https://omdbapi.com/][OMDB]].
The API only allows one film to be queried in one call, so in order to make our TUI feel quick,
it required careful use of Rust's async / await constructs, as well as some basic caching of fetched data.

*** The Finished Product
Putting this all together, it worked out quite nicely.
It was actually quite a fun way to kill time, while I was stuck on a long bus journey.

[fn:1] Reading through the screenplay for /The Social Network/, to find the relevant quote,
I was amused to be reminded that Mark Zuckerberg also had a blog (in the film at least).
*EDUARDO:* You and Erica split up?
*MARK:* How did you know that?
*EDUARDO:* It’s on your blog.
