It's 23:30 on a Saturday as I write this.
Really I should be working towards an upcoming paper deadline.
However, having just watched _The Motorcycle Diaries_,
I feel suddenly enthused to write this instead.

Though my time spent travelling South East Asia was incomparably less
impactful than Ernesto's time on the roads of South America,
I look back on my time travelling fondly.
I spent the last half an hour recounting the tales in my head,
recalling the faces I saw and the stories I exchanged with them.

It was the summer after completing my Master's degree.
The prior few months had been taxing, but immensely rewarding.
Since that Spring, I'd been working on my Master's thesis.
This is a period of my life I'll look back on with nostalgia,
it was my first taste of research, and academia.
I found myself lost in the subject area of my thesis;
it consumed my every waking hour. I'd work furiously during the day,
and fall asleep feeling tired, but deeply contented.
I'd just started dating my girlfriend, and when I was too tired to work,
I spent my evenings with her. We would mindlessly watch How I Met Your Mother,
and eat instant noodles in her cheap yet characterful student flat near Ravenscourt Park.
We'd spend evenings watching the sun set from Hammersmith Bridge.
"Bridge Walk?", I'd ask, when my mind felt too tired to make progress on
whatever problem I had been dancing with that day.
It was a beautiful spring, that melted into a warm summer.

A common sentiment among people my age is that
"University ends on a random Wednesday in June".
In my case, it was a Tuesday -- the 24th, the day after my birthday.
I hadn't celebrated my birthday, as I was preparing for the final
hurdle of my degree, an oral presentation about my thesis.
Even after completing this, I didn't have the time to process the sudden,
jarring shift from being a student, to not being one anymore.
I now had to turn my attention to a task that I'd been ignoring
while occupied with my thesis. I needed to prepare for my travels that summer.
