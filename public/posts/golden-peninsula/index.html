				<p>It&rsquo;s 23:30 on a Saturday as I write this.
Really I should be working towards an upcoming paper deadline.
However, having just watched <em>The Motorcycle Diaries</em>,
I feel suddenly enthused to write this instead.</p>
<p>Though my time spent travelling South East Asia was incomparably less
impactful than Ernesto&rsquo;s time on the roads of South America,
I look back on my time travelling fondly.
I spent the last half an hour recounting the tales in my head,
recalling the faces I saw and the stories I exchanged with them.</p>
<p>It was the summer after completing my Master&rsquo;s degree.
The prior few months had been taxing, but immensely rewarding.
Since that Spring, I&rsquo;d been working on my Master&rsquo;s thesis.
This is a period of my life I&rsquo;ll look back on with nostalgia,
it was my first taste of research, and academia.
I found myself lost in the subject area of my thesis;
it consumed my every waking hour. I&rsquo;d work furiously during the day,
and fall asleep feeling tired, but deeply contented.
I&rsquo;d just started dating my girlfriend, and when I was too tired to work,
I spent my evenings with her. We would mindlessly watch How I Met Your Mother,
and eat instant noodles in her cheap yet characterful student flat near Ravenscourt Park.
We&rsquo;d spend evenings watching the sun set from Hammersmith Bridge.
&ldquo;Bridge Walk?&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d ask, when my mind felt too tired to make progress on
whatever problem I had been dancing with that day.
It was a beautiful spring, that melted into a warm summer.</p>
<p>A common sentiment among people my age is that
&ldquo;University ends on a random Wednesday in June&rdquo;.
In my case, it was a Tuesday &ndash; the 24th, the day after my birthday.
I hadn&rsquo;t celebrated my birthday, as I was preparing for the final
hurdle of my degree, an oral presentation about my thesis.
Even after completing this, I didn&rsquo;t have the time to process the sudden,
jarring shift from being a student, to not being one anymore.
I now had to turn my attention to a task that I&rsquo;d been ignoring
while occupied with my thesis. I needed to prepare for my travels that summer.</p>
