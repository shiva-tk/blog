				<p>The train of thought that culminated in this project set off when my good friend (Rish)
sent me a list compiled by the New York Times of the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/movies/best-movies-21st-century.html">100 Best Movies of the 21st Century</a>&rdquo;.
Scrolling through the list idle mindedly, I picked out the films which I&rsquo;d seen,
silently agreeing with the list for including them. However, when given more thought,
I started to wonder the methodology behind this ranking.</p>
<p>My first instinct was to turn to Letterboxd. In recent years, a film&rsquo;s average Letterboxd rating
has become a source of truth in some sense for me. My preconceived notions and expectations about a film
are determined mostly by its average rating. Even when selecting a film to watch on lazy evenings with my flatmates,
before committing to a film, we look at its reviews.</p>
<p>This satisfied my curiosity temporarily. I assumed that the New York Times would have considered various ratings
of the film. At the very least, ranking films by their average rating is a starting point, from which an official ranking
can be refined.</p>
<p>But then I started to think about my own practices when rating a film. The truth is,
I&rsquo;m pretty terrible at assigning a rating to a film after I have seen it.
Even having watched and rated 234 of them (as of today) on Letterboxd.
There have been numerous occasions when, upon reviewing my Letterboxd activity,
I&rsquo;ve noticed inconsistencies. Films that I preferred over others, which received a lower rating.
In a large part, my rating of a film is influenced by its average rating: safety in numbers, herd mentality.
My rating can&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> incorrect if it&rsquo;s relatively close to the average.</p>
<p>I suppose that on the scale of thousands of reviews, the average rating of a film is a
relatively good indicator of how good it is. But on a personal level, my own ratings mean very little,
at least to me. I considered how I might compile my own ranking, &ldquo;The 100 Best Movies of All Time (According to Shiva)&rdquo;.
I realised that it would actually be very difficult.</p>
<p>I was reminded of an idea I had seen in <em>The Social Network</em>, a film which coincidentally I like very much,
and placed 10th place on the NYT list<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MARK:</strong>
Yea, it’s on. I’m not gonna do the farm
animals but I like the idea of comparing
two people together. It gives the whole
thing a very “Turing” feel since people’s
ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say,
choosing a number to represent each
person’s hotness like they do on
hotornot.com. The first thing we’re going
to need is a lot of pictures.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the film, Mark Zuckerberg &ndash; frustrated after breaking up with Jessica Albright &ndash;
creates a website called <em>Facemash</em>. The site asks users to pick the more attractive person out of two photos.
As people repeat this pairwise comparison, an overall ranking emerges.</p>
<p>Mathematically, what we usually call a “rating” is just a proxy for an underlying total ordering of films.
A score like 3/5, taken in isolation, tells us very little. It only becomes meaningful when we compare it
to the ratings of other films.</p>
<p>That got me thinking: what if we skipped the proxy altogether? Instead of assigning numbers to films,
we could uncover the ordering directly through comparisons. It’s hard to give a rating that faithfully
captures a film’s place in the hierarchy, but it’s much easier to choose the better of two when they’re placed side by side.</p>
<p>As such, the idea for <a href="https://github.com/shiva-tk/filmsmash">Filmsmash</a> was born.</p>
<h2 id="building-filmsmash">Building Filmsmash</h2>
<p>The idea for Filmsmash was in place. At a high level, I wanted users to be able to rank their favourite movies,
by pairwise comparison. To get a list of movies that a user had seen, we turn to Letterboxd.</p>
<h3 id="letterboxd-api--and-workaround">Letterboxd API (and Workaround)</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, obtaining API keys for Letterboxd is difficult.
However, Letterboxd does allow users to download a dump of their data in a CSV format.
Good enough, I suppose. In my head I pictured users downloading a dump of their Letterboxd data,
giving it to Filmsmash, which then ran on the films they&rsquo;ve seen to formulate a ranking.</p>
<h3 id="tui">TUI</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found good terminal based user interfaces to be extremely satisfying.
I decided that it would be fun to try building one for Filmsmash.
After some research into which libraries provided good support for building TUIs,
I settled on <a href="https://ratatui.rs/">Ratatui</a>, a Rust library for making TUIs.</p>
<h3 id="ranking-algorithm">Ranking Algorithm</h3>
<p>While Mark Zuckerberg used an Elo-based system to rank candidates on Facemash,
I think a simple merge sort approach is a better fit for our app.
In Facemash, the same pairings could appear multiple times, and different people might give different answers &ndash;
so a single vote isn’t conclusive proof of which option is <em>better</em>.
That’s why a probabilistic system like Elo made sense there.
In our case, though, we’re assuming a single user with consistent preferences:
if you say you prefer Film A over Film B once, you’ll always prefer it.
The crucial difference is uncertainty &ndash; Facemash had it, but for us, each comparison is definitive.</p>
<p>The downside to this approach is that we can&rsquo;t stop after an arbitrary number of comparisons,
the merge sort algorithm must complete. I wondered if this would require too many comparisons to be feasible.
The merge sort algorithm requires \(n \log n\) comparisons. I have 234 films that I&rsquo;ve seen.
This means to rank the films I&rsquo;ve watched, it would take \(234 \times \log(234)\) comparisons,
so around 1842 comparisons. If I average one comparison a second, it would take about thirty minutes.
Good enough. A fun way to kill time when exceedingly bored.</p>
<h3 id="film-metadata">Film Metadata</h3>
<p>I mentioned earlier that we obtain the films a user has seen by inspecting their Letterboxd data dump.
Inspecting the CSVs that are generated by Letterboxd, I realised that they were pretty limited,
containing only the essential information like a film&rsquo;s name and the year it was released.
While this is sufficient, I thought that our TUI might look a bit more fleshed out if it
included some metadata like the the director, or the plot. Luckily there are other APIs which handle this, like <a href="https://omdbapi.com/">OMDB</a>.
The API only allows one film to be queried in one call, so in order to make our TUI feel quick,
it required careful use of Rust&rsquo;s async / await constructs, as well as some basic caching of fetched data.</p>
<h2 id="the-finished-product">The Finished Product</h2>
<p>Putting this all together, it worked out quite nicely.
It was actually quite a fun way to kill time, while I was stuck on a long bus journey.</p>
